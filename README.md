# LLMs-Generated-Vis-Code
This repository contains code and data utilized for automatic data visualization using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, llama-2-coder-7b, starcoder, and deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct.

##Introduction
The objective of this project is to assess the capability of LLMs in generating visualizations from provided datasets. We evaluate their performance in adhering to instructions, generating diverse visualizations, and effectively developing code and chart images using various visualization libraries.

##Usage
- ###Setup Environment:
Ensure Python environment with required packages.
Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`.
- ###Run Streamlit App:
Execute the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.
- ###Interact with Streamlit UI:
https://llms-generated-vis-code-3r8paqrspbzpoykzhke9cn.streamlit.app/
 - Choose the question and visualization library using the dropdowns provided.
 - View generated chart images and corresponding code snippets for each Language Model.

##Files Description
`app.py`: Streamlit app for visualizing the results.
